# Dashboard: Power BI
This repository contains a dashboard created in Power BI. The purpose of this dashboard is to provide insights and visualizations based on the provided dataset.

**Project Learnings-**

During my Power BI project, I gained valuable experience and skills in various aspects of data analysis and visualization. Here are some of the key learnings from the project:

* **Interactive Dashboard Creation:** I successfully designed and developed an interactive dashboard to track and analyze online sales data. The dashboard provided a comprehensive view of key metrics and trends, enabling users to make data-driven decisions.

* **Complex Parameters and Drill-Down:** I implemented complex parameters that allowed users to drill down into specific aspects of the data. By using filters and slicers, users could customize their analysis and explore the data in more detail.

* **Data Manipulation and Calculations:** I worked with data connections and performed join operations to integrate new tables into the existing dataset. Additionally, I utilized calculations and transformations to manipulate the data and create meaningful insights.

* **Customized Visualizations:** Throughout the project, I utilized a wide range of customized visualizations to present the data effectively. This included bar charts, pie charts, donut charts, clustered bar charts, scatter charts, line charts, area charts, maps, slicers, and more. The selection of appropriate visualizations helped convey insights and trends in a clear and intuitive manner.
